# Diffusion Model Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of a Diffusion Model from scratch, based on key research papers in the field.

## Overview

Diffusion Models are a class of generative models that have shown impressive results in various domains, including image synthesis, audio generation, and more. This project aims to provide a clear, well-documented implementation to help understand the inner workings of these models.

## Key Features

- Implementation of the core Diffusion Model architecture
- Training pipeline
- Sampling/generation process
- Visualization tools for the diffusion process

## Papers Implemented

This implementation is based on the following seminal papers:
1. "Deep Unsupervised Learning using Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics" (Sohl-Dickstein et al., 2015)
2. "Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models" (Ho et al., 2020)
3. "RePaint: Inpainting using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models" (Lugmayr et al. 2022)

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/diffusion-model-implementation.git
cd diffusion-model-implementation
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

This implementation of the Diffusion Model is provided as a series of Jupyter notebooks. Jupyter notebooks allow for an interactive, step-by-step execution of the code, making it easier to understand and experiment with the model.

To run the notebooks:

1. Ensure you have Jupyter installed. If not, you can install it via pip:
   ```
   pip install jupyter
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd diffusion-model-implementation
   ```

3. Start Jupyter Notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. In the Jupyter interface that opens in your web browser, navigate to and open the desired notebook.

To run a notebook, open it and execute the cells in order. You can run a cell by selecting it and pressing Shift+Enter.

## Results

[TBD: Include some sample results or visualizations if available]

## Contributing

Contributions to improve the implementation or extend its capabilities are welcome. Please feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue for discussion.
